Your task
We would like you to build a simplified e-commerce API with a single endpoint that performs a
checkout action. The single endpoint should take a list of watches and return the total cost.
In terms of programming language, we work with Kotlin and Java 8+, if you feel that you have the
experience to build a solution in any of those languages then please do. Otherwise, we are happy for
you to build a solution using a language and framework that you feel best showcases your ability.
